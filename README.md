## Description:
An analysis of time-based trends on traffic in the greater Austin area over the past year.

## Questions to answer:
- What _time of day_ do most traffic incidents occur?

- What _day of the week_ do most traffic incidents occur?
  
- What _day of the year_ do most traffic incidents occur?
  
- _Where_ in Austin do most incidents occur?

- Are the _majority_ of incidents impediments, hazards, or accidents? 

**Data Source: [data.austintexas.gov](data.austintexas.gov)**

## Plots:
### 1) Pie Plot (Category Breakdown):
- [traffic hazards, accidents, road impediments](https://github.com/smarquardt92/project_1/blob/master/Deliverables/Plot-Pie%20-%20Category%20Breakdown.png)
### 2) Bar Graphs:
- [Total Incidents by Hour of Day](https://github.com/smarquardt92/project_1/blob/master/Deliverables/Plot-Bar%20-%20Total%20Issues%20(per%20Hour%20of%20Day).png)
- [Avereage Total Incidents per Weekday](https://github.com/smarquardt92/project_1/blob/master/Deliverables/Plot-Bar%20-%20Avg%20Issues%20(per%20Weekday).png)
### 3) line graphs:
- Total Issues per Day Over Year: [9x16](https://github.com/smarquardt92/project_1/blob/master/Deliverables/Plot-Line%20-%20Total%20Issues%20(per%20Day%20over%20Year).png) ; [Wide](https://github.com/smarquardt92/project_1/blob/master/Deliverables/Plot-Line%20-%20Total%20Issues%20(per%20Day%20over%20Year)%20-%20Wide.png)
- Total Issues for all Categories per Day Over Year: [9x16](https://github.com/smarquardt92/project_1/blob/master/Deliverables/Plot-Line%20-%20Total%20Issues%203%20Categories%20(per%20Day%20over%20Year).png) ; [Wide](https://github.com/smarquardt92/project_1/blob/master/Deliverables/Plot-Line%20-%20Total%20Issues%203%20Categories%20(per%20Day%20over%20Year)%20-%20Wide.png)
- Total Accidents per Day Over Year: [9x16](https://github.com/smarquardt92/project_1/blob/master/Deliverables/Plot-Line%20-%20Total%20Accidents%20(per%20Day%20over%20Year).png) ; [Wide](https://github.com/smarquardt92/project_1/blob/master/Deliverables/Plot-Line%20-%20Total%20Accidents%20(per%20Day%20over%20Year)%20-%20Wide.png)
### 4) "Heat" Map:
- [Geographic Map of Where Accidents Occur](https://github.com/smarquardt92/project_1/blob/master/Deliverables/Plot-HeatMap%20-%20Manual%20Download.png)

## Assumptions:
- All incidents have been accounted for and reported
- All incidents are correctly categorized
- Categories are mutually exclusive; Incident can only fall into 1 category
