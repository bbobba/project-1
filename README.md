## Description:
An analysis of time-based trends on traffic in the greater Austin area over the past year.

## Questions to answer:
- What time of day do most traffic incidents occur?

- What day of the week do most traffic incidents occur?
  
- What day of the year do most traffic incidents occur?
  
- Where in Austin do most incidents occur?

- Are the majority of incidents impediments, hazards, or accidents?

### 4. "Heat" Map:
- Geographic Map of where accidents occur

## Assumptions:
- All incidents have been accounted for and reported
- All incidents are correctly categorized
- Categories are mutually exclusive; Incident can only fall into 1 category
