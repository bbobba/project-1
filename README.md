Description:
An analysis of trends on traffic in the greater Austin area over the past 5 years.

Questions to answer:
How does time of year, day, weather, holiday, area, driver demographics affect traffic accidents?

Data sources: 
data.austintexas.gov


Endpoints:
1. line graph:
	- # of accidents per day vs. day
2. pie plot:
	- traffic hazards, accidents, road impediments
3. bar graphs:
	- number of accidents per day of the week (x-axis = unit of time, y-axis = number of accidents)
	- holiday comparison (+/- 1 day around holiday)
	- time of day (number of accidents that occur at certain point of 	day)
4. "heat" map:
	- geographic map of where accidents occur


Assumptions:
 - traffic hazards are differentiated from traffic accidents
 - compare frequency of accidents to population growth

Delegations:
- data cleaning: Luis & Omar
- "heat" map: Sarah
- bar graphs: Becky (number of accidents, holiday comparison), Sarah (time of day) 
- pie plot: Luis
- line graph: Omar
- assumptions: Omar
